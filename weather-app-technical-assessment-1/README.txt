# Weather App

Basic weather app using Python Flask backend and vanilla JS frontend.

## What I Did
- Handles locations like cities, zips, coords.
- Current weather + 5-day forecast.
- Uses current location via browser geolocation.
- Weather icons from OpenWeather.

## How to Run
1. Clone repo: `git clone <repo-url>`.
2. Install Python deps: `cd backend \&\& pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run backend: `python app.py`.
4. Open frontend/index.html in browser.
5. Enter location and click buttons.
6. If you don't have an API key create a .env file in backend and put the whole statment OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=dc09e17cd3dfd7bd1b54e8f8857e4396

App includes my name in title and info button with PM Accelerator description.
