# Weather App (Advanced)

Extended with SQLite DB for CRUD on weather records.
Optional: YouTube integration, CSV export.

## What I Did
- CRUD: Create (location/date range with validation), Read, Update (location), Delete.
- Handles fuzzy locations via API.
- Optional APIs: YouTube videos for location.
- Export: CSV.

## How to Run
(Same as above, but note DB is created automatically.)
