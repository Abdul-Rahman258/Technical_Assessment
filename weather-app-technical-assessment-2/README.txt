# Weather App (Advanced)

Extended with SQLite DB for CRUD on weather records.
Optional: YouTube integration(NOT IMPLEMENTED), CSV export.

## What I Did
- CRUD: Create (location/date range with validation), Read, Update (location), Delete.
- Handles fuzzy locations via API.
- Optional APIs: YouTube videos for location.
- Export: CSV.

## How to Run

1. If you don't have an API key create a .env file in backend and put the whole statment OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=dc09e17cd3dfd7bd1b54e8f8857e4396

(Same as above, but note DB is created automatically.)
